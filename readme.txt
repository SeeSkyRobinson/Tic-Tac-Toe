Welcome to Tic Tac Toe supreme difficulty mode.

This is the first javascript, html, css project I have completed for the GA software immersive course. Time taken: 2.5 days.

HOW TO PLAY
1. By default the game starts in alternating player mode. Each click will cycle between Player X and Player O. Player X starts by clicking a square in the grid, this will fill the square with "X" token.
2. It is now Player 0's turn. Click on a square to fill with "O" token.
3. Alternate back and forth until one player has won or both have drawn.
4. Select AI mode with the button below the grid. BE WARNED!!! THE AI NEVER LOSES (or does it?).
5. Verse the AI until bored of defeat, turn AI off for the next games by pressing the AI mode button.


KNOWN ISSUES
*Display works best on around 800px wide screens.
*When resizing the window the elements will overlap and not scale correctly.
*When the AI is trying to randomly determine a square to play, if all squares are taken it will throw an error message. This is due to the fact that it's parsing NaN into the index position of the squares.
*Colors and styles are garbage.
*Messy code and inefficient code.

FUTURE STEPS
*Fixing known issues
*Adding in customizable style features
*Saving local highscores

BIGGEST LEARNDINGS
*The AI section was both the biggest time-sync and achievement during this build. If it can win it will, if it can block your winning move it will, if it can't do either of these moves it will select a random empty square.
*Keeping the code tidy and concise became more of an apparent issue as the build progressed. Utilising more functions and calling them where appropriate instead of janking sections together would be better in future.

FINAL FAREWELLS
*I look forward to seeing the improvements I'm bound to make in my coding journey. This was at the time of writting the best of my ability. So long and thanks for all the fish.
